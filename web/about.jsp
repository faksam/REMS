            <h1>REMS - Real Estate Management System</h1>

                Real estate management is the operation, control, and oversight of 
                real estate as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates 
                a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its 
                useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management 
                in any business.</p>
            <p>
                Real estate management is also the management of personal property, 
                equipment, tooling and physical capital assets that are acquired and 
                used to build, repair and maintain end item deliverables. Property 
                management involves the processes, systems and manpower required to 
                manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including 
                acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization and disposition.
